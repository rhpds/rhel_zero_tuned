TuneD is a service that monitors your system and optimizes the
performance under certain workloads

TuneD is distributed with a number of predefined profiles, which we will
review a little later in this exercise

Let’s make sure we have the `+tuned+` package installed.

Copy and paste the command below into *> Shell*.

[source,bash]
----
dnf list tuned
----

The output should look similar to this:

root@rhel:~# dnf list tuned Updating Subscription Management
repositories. Last metadata expiration check: 0:02:56 ago on Mon 06 Feb
2023 08:35:50 PM UTC. Installed Packages tuned.noarch 2.19.0-1.el9
@rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms root@rhel:~#

....

We can see `tuned` is listed under Installed Packages.  We should also make sure it is running and enabled:

Copy and paste the command below into __> Shell__.

```bash
systemctl status tuned
....

Your output should look similiar to:

root@rhel:~# systemctl status tuned ● tuned.service - Dynamic System
Tuning Daemon Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/tuned.service;
enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Mon

Feb 06 20:37:34 rhel systemd[1]: Started Dynamic System Tuning Daemon.
root@rhel:~#

```

From the output above we can determine that it is active (running) and
that it is enabled so it will start at boot-up time

Let’s move on to the next step
